1. What type of operations has Git been optimized for?
A. local file manipulation and offline work
B. remote collaboration and real-time editing
C. cloud-based operations and synchronization
D. web development and browser-based coding
Answer: A 
Explanation:

2. Which of the following keywords are used to link a pull request to an issue? (Choose three.)
A. fix
B. resolves
C. merge
D. join
E. closed
F. connects
Answer: A,B,E
Explanation:

3. Who can be assigned to an Issue or pull request? (Each answer presents a complete solution. Choose two.)
A. Anyone who has an enterprise GitHub account
B. Anyone who has commented on the Issue or pull request
C. Anyone who has a personal GitHub account
D. Anyone with write permissions to the repository
Answer: B,D
Explanation:
In GitHub, issues and pull requests (PRs) are essential tools for managing work and collaboration in a project. Assigning individuals to these issues or PRs is a way to indicate responsibility for addressing the issue or completing the PR.
Anyone with write permissions to the repository:
Users who have write permissions to a repository can be assigned to issues and pull requests. Write permissions allow users to push changes to the repository, create branches, and modify issues and pull requests. Assigning them to an issue or PR ensures they are recognized as responsible for the task.
Anyone who has commented on the Issue or pull request:
GitHub allows you to assign issues or pull requests to users who have already engaged with the discussion by commenting on it. This feature is particularly useful for quickly assigning tasks to those who are already involved in the conversation.
Incorrect Options:
Option A is incorrect because having an enterprise GitHub account alone does not necessarily grant the ability to be assigned to issues or PRs. Permission to assign is based on repository-specific roles and permissions.
Option C is incorrect because not all personal GitHub accounts can be assigned to issues or PRs. The user needs either write permissions to the repository or must have commented on the issue or PR.

4. What are two recommended ways of improving the discoverability of a repository?(Each answer presents a complete solution. Choose two.)
A. Register the repository with GitHub search.
B. Create a README file describing the repository.
C. Add labels to categorize the repository.
D. Add topics to classify the repository.
Answer: B,D
Explanation:
Two recommended ways to improve the discoverability of a repository on GitHub are:
B. Create a README file describing the repository: A well-written README file provides essential information about the project, such as what it does, how to use it, and how to contribute. This is often the first thing potential users or contributors will see, making it critical for discoverability.
D. Add topics to classify the repository: Adding topics to your repository helps classify it under specific categories, making it easier for others to find it through GitHub’s search and exploration features. Topics act like tags, helping to connect your project with users interested in similar subjects.
Registering a repository with GitHub search and adding labels are not applicable actions for improving discoverability in the broader sense.

5. Which of the following items can you customize for an individual Codespace? (Each answer presents a complete solution. Choose three.)
A. Shell
B. Branch protections
C. Name
D. Default editor
E. Operating system
Answer: A,C,D
Explanation:
When using GitHub Codespaces, you can customize several aspects of the development environment:
Shell: You can choose the default shell to be used in the Codespace, such as Bash, Zsh, or PowerShell.
Name: Users can customize the name of their Codespace for easier identification.
Default editor: You can choose which editor to use within the Codespace, such as Visual Studio Code or others that may be supported.
Branch protections and the operating system are not customizable for an individual Codespace within GitHub, making the options Shell, Name, and Default editor the correct answers.

6. As a GitHub user, where in the UI can you configure two-factor authentication (2FA) to further secure your account?
A. Profile -> Account -> 2FA
B. Repository Settings -> Secrets and Variables -> 2FA
C. Organization Settings -> Authentication Security -> 2FA
D. Settings -> Password and Authentication -> 2FA
Answer: D
Explanation:
As a GitHub user, you can configure two-factor authentication (2FA) to secure your account by navigating to Settings -> Password and Authentication -> 2FA. This section in the GitHub user interface allows you to set up and manage your 2FA methods, which provide an additional layer of security beyond just your password.

7. Which of the following describes a branch in Git?
A. A pointer to an identical snapshot of the project at a specific point in time
B. A physical copy of the entire project stored on disk
C. A separate, isolated copy of the project's codebase
D. A new repository that shares code with the original "upstream" repository
Answer: C
Explanation:
In Git, a branch is a fundamental concept that represents an independent line of development
within a project. Here's a more detailed explanation:
Branch in Git:
Option C is correct because a branch in Git is essentially a separate, isolated copy of the project's codebase where you can make changes without affecting the main codebase.
Branches allow developers to work on features, fixes, or experiments in parallel to the main project.
Other Options:
Option A is incorrect because while a branch does point to a specific commit (which represents a snapshot of the project), the description lacks the emphasis on the isolated and parallel development aspect that is critical to the understanding of branches.
Option B is incorrect because a branch is not a physical copy stored on disk; it is a logical reference within the repository.
Option D is incorrect because that description better fits the concept of a fork, not a branch. A fork is a new repository that is a copy of another repository, usually used to contribute back to the original ("upstream") repository.

8. GitHub Actions workflows can be directly triggered by which of the following events?(Each answer presents a complete solution. Choose three.)
A. Adding a comment to a discussion post
B. Creating a new repository
C. Committing a change to a local git repository
D. Pushing to a GitHub repository
E. Disabling a GitHub runner
F. Creating an Issue
Answer: A,D,F
Explanation:
GitHub Actions are automated workflows that can be triggered by various events on GitHub.
Some common events that trigger workflows include pushes to a repository, creation of issues,
and comments on discussion posts.
Triggering GitHub Actions:
Option D (Pushing to a GitHub repository) is correct because this is one of the most common
triggers for CI/CD workflows.
Option F (Creating an Issue) is correct because issues are commonly used as triggers for
workflows, such as automatically assigning a label or notifying a team.
Option A (Adding a comment to a discussion post) is correct because actions can be triggered
by activity on discussion posts, including comments.
Incorrect Options:
Option B (Creating a new repository) is incorrect because this action typically does not trigger
workflows within a specific repository.
Option C (Committing a change to a local git repository) is incorrect because GitHub Actions are
triggered by events on the GitHub platform, not by local commits.
Option E (Disabling a GitHub runner) is incorrect because it is related to the environment where
actions are executed, not a trigger for workflows.
Reference: GitHub Docs: Events That Trigger Workflows

9. Workflows can reference actions in: (Each correct answer presents a complete solution. Choose three.)
A. Any public repository.
B. The same repository as your workflow file.
C. GitHub Packages.
D. An enterprise marketplace.
E. A published Docker container image on Docker Hub.
Answer: A,B,E
Explanation:
As mentioned in the answer to Question no. 66, GitHub Actions workflows can reference actions
from a variety of sources:
Any Public Repository:
Option A is correct. Actions can be sourced from any public GitHub repository.
The Same Repository as Your Workflow File:
Option B is correct. Actions within the same repository as the workflow file can be referenced
directly.
A Published Docker Container Image on Docker Hub:
Option E is correct. Workflows can also use actions provided as Docker container images from
Docker Hub.
Incorrect Options:
Option C and D are not relevant for directly referencing actions in workflows.
Reference: GitHub Docs: Reusing Workflows

10. Which of the following is an Innersource development practice?
A. Adopting open source code into the organization
B. Sharing code between teams within the organization
C. Removing open source code from the organization
D. Making all repositories publicly accessible
Answer: B
Explanation:
Innersource is a development practice where an organization adopts open-source development methodologies within its own internal environment. The primary goal of innersource is to break down silos and encourage collaboration across different teams within the organization.
Sharing Code Between Teams:
Option B is correct because innersource involves sharing code between teams within the organization, similar to how open-source communities share code across the public domain.
This practice fosters collaboration, improves code quality, and allows for reuse of code, reducing duplication of efforts.
Incorrect Options:
Option A is incorrect because adopting open-source code into the organization is related to using open-source software, not specifically to innersource practices.
Option C is incorrect because removing open-source code from the organization is contrary to the principles of both open source and innersource.
Option D is incorrect because making all repositories publicly accessible refers to open source, not innersource. Innersource typically involves keeping code internal to the organization.
Reference: GitHub Docs: What is Innersource?
Innersource Commons: The Basics

11. What are three valid states for a file in a git repository? (Each correct answer presents part of the solution. Choose three.)
A. Committed
B. Modified
C. Uncommitted
D. Staged
E. Tracked
Answer: A, B, D
Explanation:
In a Git repository, a file can be in one of the following three valid states:
Committed: The file is saved in the local repository. It is part of the permanent history of the project.
Modified: The file has been changed but not yet staged or committed. It is in the working directory.
Staged: The file has been marked to be included in the next commit. It is in the staging area, ready to be committed.
These states represent the typical lifecycle of a file as it moves through the process of being edited, reviewed, and saved in Git.

12. What is the minimum access needed to contribute to a repository?
A. Read
B. Triage
C. Maintain
D. Write
Answer: D
Explanation:
To contribute to a GitHub repository, a user typically needs to be able to create branches, push changes, and open pull requests. These actions require Write access, which is the minimum level of access needed to contribute code directly to a repository.
Write Access:
Option D is correct because "Write" access allows users to contribute to the repository by pushing changes, creating branches, and opening pull requests. This is the minimum required access level for contributing code.
Incorrect Options:
Option A (Read) is incorrect because "Read" access only allows viewing the repository, not making changes.
Option B (Triage) is incorrect because while Triage access allows managing issues and pull requests, it does not allow pushing code.
Option C (Maintain) is incorrect because "Maintain" access includes additional permissions beyond those needed for basic contributions, such as managing repository settings.
Reference: GitHub Docs: Repository Roles for an Organization

13. Which of the following steps are part of the Codespaces lifecycle? (Each answer presents a complete solution. Choose three.)
A. Commit
B. Create
C. Rebuild
D. Clone
E. Delete
Answer: B,C,E
Explanation:
The Codespaces lifecycle on GitHub includes several key steps:
Create: This is the step where a new Codespace is initiated.
Rebuild: A Codespace can be rebuilt to ensure that the environment is up-to-date with the latest code or configurations.
Delete: Once a Codespace is no longer needed, it can be deleted to free up resources.
Committing, cloning, or installing are typical Git operations but are not considered part of the specific lifecycle steps for a GitHub Codespace.

14. The difference between GitHub Desktop and github.com is that Desktop:
A. Is a standalone software application.
B. Enables integration with office suite applications.
C. Is only available on Windows operating systems.
D. Offers a graphical user interface.
E. Is a self-hosted version of GitHub.
Answer: D
Explanation:
GitHub Desktop is a standalone application that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for interacting with GitHub repositories, as opposed to the command-line or web-based interfaces available on github.com.
Graphical User Interface:
Option D is correct because GitHub Desktop offers a GUI, making it easier for users to manage repositories, perform commits, and handle other Git-related tasks without needing to use the command line.
Incorrect Options:
Option A is partially correct in that GitHub Desktop is a standalone application, but the key difference is the GUI.
Option B is incorrect because GitHub Desktop does not specifically enable integration with office suite applications.
Option C is incorrect because GitHub Desktop is available on both Windows and macOS.
Option E is incorrect because GitHub Desktop is not a self-hosted version of GitHub; it is a client application for accessing GitHub repositories.

15. What features are offered by Copilot for Business that are not offered by Copilot for individuals? (Each answer presents a complete solution. Choose three.)
A. Offers multi-line function suggestions
B. Organization-wide policy management
C. Blocks suggestions matching public code
D. VPN proxy support via self-signed certificates
E. Support for organization or enterprise GitHub accounts
F. Plugs directly into the editor

Answer: B,C,E
Explanation:
GitHub Copilot for Business offers several features that are tailored to the needs of organizations, providing more control, security, and support compared to the individual version.
Organization-wide Policy Management:
Option B is correct because Copilot for Business allows organizations to manage policies across their entire user base, providing control over how Copilot is used within the organization.
Blocking Suggestions Matching Public Code:
Option C is correct because Copilot for Business includes enhanced security features, such as blocking code suggestions that match public code to prevent inadvertent use of unlicensed code.
Support for Organization or Enterprise GitHub Accounts:
Option E is correct because Copilot for Business supports integration with GitHub Enterprise accounts, offering additional administrative controls and integration capabilities.
Incorrect Options:
Option A (multi-line function suggestions) is a feature available in both individual and business versions, so it does not differentiate the business offering.
Option D (VPN proxy support via self-signed certificates) is not a primary differentiator of Copilot for Business.
Option F (plugs directly into the editor) is true for both individual and business versions, so it is not unique to Copilot for Business.

16. What are primary benefits of using GitHub issues templates? (Each answer presents a complete solution. Choose two.)
A. To automatically label or assign newly created issues
B. To provide an easy-to-fill-out form for creating new issues
C. To easily coerce existing issues into a standard format
D. To automatically create new branches when issues are created
Answer: A,B
Explanation:
The primary benefits of using GitHub issues templates include:
A . To automatically label or assign newly created issues: Issue templates can be configured to automatically apply labels or assign users when the issue is created, helping to streamline triage and management processes.
B . To provide an easy-to-fill-out form for creating new issues: Templates provide a standardized format for submitting issues, ensuring that all necessary information is captured and reducing the need for follow-up questions.
Coercing existing issues into a standard format or automatically creating new branches when issues are created are not functions provided by GitHub issues templates.

17. What layouts are available for GitHub Projects? (Each answer presents a complete solution. Choose three.)
A. Roadmap
B. Kanban
C. Board
D. Table
E. Backlog
Answer: B,C,D
Explanation:
GitHub Projects supports various layouts to help teams organize and visualize their work. The available layouts include:
B . Kanban: This is a visual task management tool where tasks are represented as cards and moved across columns that represent different stages of work.
C . Board: This layout is similar to Kanban but can be more flexible, allowing users to set up boards in various ways to suit their workflow needs.
D . Table: The Table layout allows you to view your tasks in a spreadsheet-like format, making it easy to manage and edit large amounts of data at once.
Roadmap and Backlog are not standard layouts provided by GitHub Projects. While these terms might be relevant in other project management contexts, GitHub Projects specifically offers Kanban, Board, and Table layouts.

18. Which of the following best describes GitHub Pages?
A. Webpages hosted and published through GitHub repositories
B. Handles pagination for API requests
C. Hosts long-form documentation about your project
D. Curated guides around how to use GitHub products
Answer: A
Explanation:
GitHub Pages is a feature provided by GitHub that allows you to create webpages hosted and published through GitHub repositories. It is commonly used for hosting project documentation, personal websites, or blogs directly from a GitHub repository. It integrates seamlessly with the repository, making it easy to deploy and manage website content.

19. A distributed version control system is best described as a system that:
A. Relies on a central server to store the entire project history and allows developers to check out files for editing.
B. Stores project files on a cloud-based server and allows multiple developers to collaborate on the same codebase simultaneously.
C. Ensures each developer has their own local copy of the entire code repository, including the complete project history and metadata.
D. Requires developers to manually track and manage different versions of their files using naming conventions and manual backups.
Answer: C
Explanation:
A distributed version control system (DVCS) like Git is best described as a system that ensures each developer has their own local copy of the entire code repository, including the complete project history and metadata. This decentralized approach allows developers to work independently, with full access to the project's history and files, and later synchronize their changes with others. Unlike centralized systems, DVCS does not rely on a single central server, which provides greater flexibility and robustness in collaboration.

20. An engineering team at NimbusWorks wants to deploy GitHub Copilot for developers who use a mix of editors on Windows and macOS, so which group of IDEs is compatible with GitHub Copilot?
A. Eclipse, NetBeans, and Sublime Text
B. Visual Studio Code, Xcode, and Android Studio
C. Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, and JetBrains IDEs
D. Google Cloud Shell Editor, Atom, and Notepad++
Answer: C
Explanation:
The correct option is Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, and JetBrains IDEs.
This group matches the officially supported environments for GitHub Copilot and it works across Windows and macOS. GitHub provides first party extensions for Microsoft editors and JetBrains IDEs, and there is an official plugin for Vim that enables the same functionality. Together these cover the major cross platform IDEs and editors that developers commonly use.
Eclipse, NetBeans, and Sublime Text is incorrect because there are no official GitHub Copilot integrations for these editors, so this set does not meet the compatibility requirement.
Visual Studio Code, Xcode, and Android Studio is incorrect because the set contains an editor that is not supported by GitHub Copilot, which means the whole group does not satisfy the requirement even though some items are compatible.
Google Cloud Shell Editor, Atom, and Notepad++ is incorrect because these editors do not have official Copilot support. Atom has also been retired which makes it even less likely to appear as a valid option on newer exams.
Cameron’s Certification Exam Tip
Anchor on the officially supported list of editors. Eliminate any set that includes an editor with no first party Copilot extension and watch for retired products that are unlikely to be correct.

21. BlueFin Analytics has release coordinators who must handle routine repository management like triaging issues, applying labels and milestones, and guiding pull request workflows, yet they must not be able to delete the repository or administer security and team access. Which GitHub permission level should they receive?
A. Triage
B. Write
C. Maintain
D. Read
Answer: C
Explanation:
The correct option is Maintain because it allows release coordinators to triage issues, apply labels and milestones, and guide pull request workflows while withholding admin and destructive capabilities such as deleting the repository or administering security and team access.
This role is designed for people who manage a repository day to day. It enables full issue and pull request management including labeling, milestone management, and merging or coordinating merges. It also allows non sensitive repository management like releases and some settings while preventing actions reserved for administrators such as changing visibility, deleting or transferring the repository, or managing teams and security settings.
The Triage role focuses on managing issues and pull requests without write access and it cannot merge pull requests or perform broader repository management, so it does not meet the coordination and workflow needs described.
The Write role grants push access and permits merging pull requests, yet it does not include the wider non sensitive repository management capabilities that coordinators typically need, and it is not the role GitHub recommends for repository managers who must avoid admin powers.
The Read role is view only and cannot triage, label, milestone, or guide pull requests, so it clearly does not satisfy the requirements.
Cameron’s Certification Exam Tip
Map the scenario verbs to roles. If you see manage the repository but avoid admin or destructive actions then prefer Maintain. If the tasks are only triaging issues and pull requests without merging then choose Triage. Pushing code and merging point to Write while view only points to Read.

22. A small engineering team at scrumtuous.com is starting a new app on GitHub and needs a place to keep the project’s code along with all files and the history of every change. Which GitHub element should they choose?
A. GitHub Codespaces
B. GitHub Discussions
C. A place to keep a project’s source code, supporting files, and the full history of changes
D. GitHub Packages
Answer: C
Explanation:
The correct option is A place to keep a project’s source code, supporting files, and the full history of changes. This describes a GitHub repository which stores code and related files and preserves the complete commit history for collaboration and tracking.
A repository is the core unit of version control on GitHub. It records every commit and supports collaborative workflows so it is exactly what a team needs when starting a new app and wanting to keep all code and its change history in one place.
GitHub Codespaces is a cloud developer environment for writing and running code, yet it is not the system that stores a project’s files and version history.
GitHub Discussions is for community conversations and Q and A and it is not where source code and its history are kept.
GitHub Packages is a package registry for publishing and consuming packages and it does not serve as the repository that tracks code and changes.
Cameron’s Certification Exam Tip
Match the need to the capability. If the question emphasizes storing code with its full history then think of a repository rather than tools for editing, chatting, or distributing artifacts.

23. An engineer at scrumtuous.com opens a new GitHub Codespace for a repository and wants to know which operating system the remote development container uses by default. Which operating system does the codespace run by default?
A. Windows
B. macOS
C. Ubuntu Linux
D. Debian
Answer: C
Explanation:
The correct option is Ubuntu Linux.
GitHub Codespaces runs a development container on a GitHub hosted Linux virtual machine by default. The default image that GitHub provides is the Dev Containers universal image which is built on Ubuntu. This means a new codespace starts with an Ubuntu based container unless the repository configures a different image in a devcontainer.json file.
Windows is not the operating system for the container in GitHub Codespaces. A codespace does not run Windows as the container operating system on GitHub hosted infrastructure.
macOS is not offered as a container operating system in GitHub Codespaces. You cannot run a macOS container in this environment.
Debian is not the default even though it is related to Ubuntu. You can choose a Debian based image by configuring a devcontainer.json file but that is not the default.
Cameron’s Certification Exam Tip
When a question asks about the Codespaces operating system, think of the container that runs in the cloud and not your local machine. If no image is specified in devcontainer.json, expect the default to be Linux.

24. As a maintainer on several community repositories, Maya finds it hard to track alerts and tags across many projects. She needs to review only conversations where she was explicitly mentioned so she can respond before a minor release this afternoon. How can Maya quickly filter GitHub notifications so that only items generated by mentions are displayed?
A. Create a custom filter in Dependabot to show items where she is tagged
B. Apply the filter query reason:mention in her GitHub notifications inbox
C. Rely on the default inbox view which only includes mention notifications
D. Filter the notifications inbox using the query is:mention
Answer: B
Explanation:
The correct option is Apply the filter query reason:mention in her GitHub notifications inbox.
GitHub notifications support query qualifiers that let you narrow the inbox by the reason each notification was generated. Using reason:mention shows only items created because someone explicitly mentioned her username, which is exactly what she needs to review before the release.
Create a custom filter in Dependabot to show items where she is tagged is incorrect because Dependabot focuses on dependency updates and alerts rather than the general notifications inbox, so it will not filter conversations based on mentions across repositories.
Rely on the default inbox view which only includes mention notifications is wrong because the default view includes many reasons such as assignments, reviews, team mentions and repository activity, and it does not restrict the list to mentions.
Filter the notifications inbox using the query is:mention is incorrect because is:mention is not a supported notifications qualifier and the correct family for this need is the reason qualifiers.
Cameron’s Certification Exam Tip
When a question asks for filtering by why a notification was generated, look for the reason qualifiers such as reason:mention rather than issue search style qualifiers.

25. In the BrightForge Robotics GitHub organization, a few trusted members are assigned the Organization Moderator role to help keep discussions healthy. Beyond the capabilities of standard members, which actions can these moderators perform across the organization and its public repositories? (Choose 3)
A. Hide comments in public repositories owned by the organization
B. Approve and install GitHub Apps for the entire organization
C. Configure interaction limits at the organization level and at the repository level
D. Block and unblock non member contributors from the organization
Answer: A,C,D
Explanation:
The correct options are Hide comments in public repositories owned by the organization, Configure interaction limits at the organization level and at the repository level, and Block and unblock non member contributors from the organization.
Organization moderators can hide comments on issues, pull requests, and discussions across repositories the organization owns, including public repositories. This allows them to remove disruptive or off topic content from view while preserving context for future review.
Moderators can also configure interaction limits for the entire organization and for individual repositories. This lets them temporarily restrict activity from certain users or from recently created accounts to slow down spam or harassment.
Finally, moderators can block and unblock non member contributors from the organization. This prevents abusive or disruptive users who are not members from interacting with any organization owned repositories and it can be reversed when appropriate.
The option Approve and install GitHub Apps for the entire organization is incorrect because only organization owners can approve and install Apps for the organization. Moderators focus on community health rather than administrative app management.
Cameron’s Certification Exam Tip
Match the action to the role focus. If the verbs relate to moderation such as hide, limit, or block then think moderator. If the action affects integrations, billing, or organization wide configuration then it usually belongs to owners.

26. Sofia uses a laptop keyboard layout that does not let her use the dot key shortcut to launch the web editor. How else can she open a GitHub repository in the github.dev editor?
A. Use the Extensions view
B. Open Cloud Shell Editor and clone the repository
C. Change the browser URL from github.com to github.dev
D. Press Alt plus Up Arrow
Answer: C
Explanation:
The correct option is Change the browser URL from github.com to github.dev.
This method opens the repository directly in the web-based editor in the browser and it works from repository, file, commit, and pull request views. It does not require installing anything and it avoids the need for a keyboard shortcut when the period key is not available.
Use the Extensions view is incorrect because this view manages extensions inside an editor session and it does not launch the browser editor from a repository page.
Open Cloud Shell Editor and clone the repository is incorrect because that is a different cloud editor from another service and it requires cloning into a separate environment rather than opening the GitHub web editor for the current repository.
Press Alt plus Up Arrow is incorrect because this is not a GitHub action to open the browser editor and it is typically a navigation shortcut inside editors instead.
Cameron’s Certification Exam Tip
When a shortcut is unavailable, look for a simple URL change or menu path that performs the same action. Domain swaps are common clues for opening web editors quickly.

27. A product team at scrumtuous.com needs to integrate with GitHub and must choose between a GitHub App and an OAuth app. What is the key difference in how these two options grant access and permissions to repositories and organization data?
A. Only verified organizations can publish GitHub Apps to GitHub Marketplace
B. GitHub Apps provide fine grained permissions and can request only the scopes they need
C. OAuth apps are required if you plan to charge for an app on GitHub Marketplace
D. OAuth apps let you define repository level permissions that are more granular than GitHub Apps
Answer: B
Explanation:
The correct option is GitHub Apps provide fine grained permissions and can request only the scopes they need.
GitHub Apps are installed on specific organizations or users and on selected repositories. During installation you can choose exactly which repositories the app may access and you can grant read or write permissions for distinct resource types such as issues or pull requests. The app then uses short lived installation tokens that include only the granted repositories and permissions, which enforces least privilege.
By contrast, OAuth apps act on behalf of a user and receive a user token that carries broad scopes which map to high level capabilities. The token inherits the user’s repository access within those scopes and the app cannot independently request narrowly tailored permissions for individual resource types. This is why the GitHub App model is more fine grained for repository and organization data.
Only verified organizations can publish GitHub Apps to GitHub Marketplace is incorrect because verification status is not the distinguishing factor for how access and permissions are granted. Verification is a marketplace trust attribute and does not define the permission model.
OAuth apps are required if you plan to charge for an app on GitHub Marketplace is incorrect because pricing and billing are not what separates the access models. Charging is independent of whether you use a GitHub App or an OAuth app and does not determine the permission granularity.
OAuth apps let you define repository level permissions that are more granular than GitHub Apps is incorrect because OAuth relies on broad user scopes and inherited access, while GitHub Apps offer the more granular per permission and per repository model.
Cameron’s Certification Exam Tip
When comparing GitHub App and OAuth app choices, focus on who the token represents. If the app acts as itself with installation tokens and per repository permissions then it is a GitHub App. If it acts as a user with broad scopes then it is an OAuth app.

28. Which of the following steps are part of the Codespaces lifecycle? (Each answer presents a complete solution. Choose three.)
A. Commit
B. Create
C. Rebuild
D. Rollback
E. Delete
Answer: B,C,E
Explanation:
The Codespaces lifecycle on GitHub includes several key steps:
Create: This is the step where a new Codespace is initiated.
Rebuild: A Codespace can be rebuilt to ensure that the environment is up-to-date with the latest code or configurations.
Delete: Once a Codespace is no longer needed, it can be deleted to free up resources.
Committing, cloning, or installing are typical Git operations but are not considered part of the specific lifecycle steps for a GitHub Codespace.
